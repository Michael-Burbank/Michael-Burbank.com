					<h2>About</h2>
					<p class="text-md md:text-xl font-semibold text-left word-wrap">
						As a former Army veteran turned Software Engineer, I bring a disciplined, strategic approach to technology, combining problem-solving skills with innovative thinking. With an Associate’s Degree in Full Stack Web Development and currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Mobile Application Development, I transitioned into the tech industry to develop efficient, user-centered digital solutions.

						I actively contribute to open-source projects, collaborating with developers worldwide to create impactful and scalable technologies. My work spans web applications, mobile development, and UX-focused designs that enhance accessibility and user engagement. By leveraging Agile methodologies, I ensure every project is iterative, feedback-driven, and aligned with business objectives. Notably, my contributions to projects like the browser extension,<strong>“Dark Reader”</strong>, or even <strong>"Activision Blizzard King's (ABK) Annual Game Jam"</strong> just to name a couple, highlight my dedication to inclusive, user-friendly software.

						As someone with ADHD, I share personal strategies to help others manage focus, productivity, and time effectively in the tech world. Whether using Notion for task management, noise-canceling headphones for deep work, or distraction-blocking apps, my insights have resonated with many coders. Through platforms like Instagram, LinkedIn, and Lemon8, I create content that fosters a supportive space for ADHD developers.
						<br><br>
						Beyond coding and communicating with stakeholders, I’m passionate about traveling, skydiving, hiking, and exploring the outdoors with my dog. Music and community involvement also play a big role in my life, blending creativity, technology, and personal growth to inspire and empower others in software development.
